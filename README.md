# NorthTechathon 2022 - Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Detection System

## Introduction:
During the 2022 NorthTechathon competition, I played a key role in developing an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection system. Our team employed a combination of Logistic, Lasso, and Sequential ensemble learning models to assist banks in identifying potential money laundering transactions based on transactional behavior. As a result of our efforts, we successfully engineered a system with a remarkable money laundering detection accuracy of up to 72%.

## Purpose and Value Alignment:
This experience profoundly resonates with my core values, as I firmly believe in the ethical utilization of technology to address societal challenges rather than purely for commercial gains. The AML detection system we developed serves a crucial role in preventing financial crimes, thereby safeguarding societal wealth and resources. Beyond being a technical endeavor, our work underscores a strong sense of responsibility towards creating a safer and more just environment for society. By participating in this competition and contributing to the development of this system, I had the opportunity to align technology with my values and make tangible contributions towards societal well-being.

## Key Takeaways:
- Enhanced Understanding: Participation in this project deepened my understanding of financial crime detection methodologies and the complexities surrounding AML efforts.
- Technical Skills Showcase: This experience provided a platform to showcase my technical skills in machine learning and ensemble learning techniques.
- Teamwork and Collaboration: Working collaboratively with a diverse team underscored the importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving project objectives.

## Conclusion:
Participating in the development of the AML detection system for the NorthTechathon 2022 was not merely a competition but a meaningful endeavor that allowed me to merge my values with technology. It reinforced my belief in the potential of technology to contribute positively to society and reaffirmed my commitment to ethical and responsible technological innovation.
